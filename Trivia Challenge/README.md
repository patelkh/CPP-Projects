Trivia Challenge tests a player's knowledge with a series of multiple-choice questions. Each question presents the player with 4 possible answers, only one of which is correct. A correct answer earns the player 1000 points. The game delivers the questions as single "episode." The program saves the final score of each game to a text file so that you have a record for every time the game was played. 

The questions for an episode are stored in a separate file, independent of the game code. This way, it's easy to play different episodes. Even better, it means anyone with a text editor can create their own trivia episode about whatever topic they choose. 

This program focuses on the following c++ topics:
- files and streams
