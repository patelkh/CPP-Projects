Guess my number is a classic number-guessing game. The program chooses a secret random number between 1 and 100 and the player tries to guess the number in a few attempts as possible. Each time a player enters a guess, the program tells the player whether the guess is too high, too low or right on the money. Once the player guesses the number, the game is over. 

This program focuses on:
- Branching (if statements)
- Loops (do ...while)
