The Inventory program simulates a simple inventory system of a role-playing game (RPG). The user is presented with a menu and may choose to add or remove items e.g., sword, axe, shield, gold and potion to or from the user's inventory. The inventory can hold up to three of these items at once. 

This program focuses on the following c++ topics:
- Passing individual and arrays of Pointers to functions (for indirect access to objects)
